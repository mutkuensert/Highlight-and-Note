## About The Project
This is basically a notepad application. But it makes easier to create notes from texts reside in other applications.
Simply, when a user select a text in somewhere on phone, the application name Highlight & Note appears in the context menu.
If user taps on the application name, the application receives the text via [intent](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-filters) 
and the user can create a new note or add the selected text to a previously saved note.
